                    <p>I am an international student from Nigeria and a sophomore studying Computer Science at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania. I am on a journey to become a full-stack software developer, and I am actively working toward that goal by taking relevant courses and joining programs that help me grow.

                    <br>I am someone who loves setting goals and chasing them with purpose. I care deeply about creativity, making an impact, and building things that make life easier and better for others. My passion for people drives my interest in tech, because at the end of the day, I want to create solutions that help and bring joy to others.

                    <br>Outside of my career, I am someone who is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with God, my source of joy, happiness, hope, and the rock on which I stand, and I strive to let His love and guidance reflect in everything I do, from the way I treat people to the goals I pursue and the impact I aim to make in the world.

                    <br>To sum it all up: I am a driven individual, passionate about making a difference in the world, with God as my guiding force every step of the way.</p>
