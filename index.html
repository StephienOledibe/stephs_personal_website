                    <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                        <p>I am an international student from Nigeria and a sophomore studying Computer Science at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania. I am on a journey to become a full-stack software developer, and I am actively working toward that goal by taking relevant courses and joining programs that help me grow.

                        <br>I am someone who loves setting goals and chasing them with purpose. I care deeply about creativity, making an impact, and building things that make life easier and better for others. My passion for people drives my interest in tech, because at the end of the day, I want to create solutions that help and bring joy to others.

                        <br>Outside of my career, I am someone who is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with God, my source of joy, happiness, hope, and the rock on which I stand. I strive to let His love and guidance reflect in everything I do, from the way I treat people to the goals I pursue and the impact I aim to make in the world.

                        <br>Two of my favorite Bible verses are Jeremiah 29:11 — “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope”, and Romans 9:16, “So then, it does not depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.” These verses remind me that God already knows the plans he has for me, and that everything that happens in my life is not dependent on my own desire or effort, but on His master plan, His grace, and His perfect timing.

                        <br>To sum it all up: I am a driven individual, passionate about making a difference in the world, with God as my guiding force every step of the way. PS: I love purple.</p>

            <h2>Battle of the Brains Competition (2025)</h2>
            <p>
                I had the incredible opportunity to represent my university for the first time at the 8th Annual HBCU Battle of the Brains, a prestigious 24-hour hackathon-style competition that brought together students from 25 Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the nation. As a first-time participant, I collaborated with a dynamic team of students from diverse backgrounds to tackle a real-world digital advertising challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My diverse team designed <strong>AmazonWish</strong>, an innovative virtual try-on app for Amazon Marketplace to improve digital ads and reduce waste. Competing for the first time, we earned 3rd place, showcasing our creativity, technical skills, and teamwork under pressure.

                Through a variety of interactive workshops, main stage presentations, and personalized coaching sessions, I was able to strengthen my skills such as effective communication, leadership, problem-solving, and networking.

I connected with professionals, explored the consulting field, and gained valuable advice for launching my career. One highlight was touring Disney World with fellow participants — an unforgettable experience that combined learning with fun, team bonding, and new friendships that I continue to cherish.

We received detailed feedback that helped us grow as developers and communicators, and I was recognized with a certificate and scholarship for outstanding performance. The program strengthened my technical foundation, boosted my confidence presenting ideas, and inspired me to keep creating real-world projects that solve meaningful problems.

                At the KWK Coding Conference, I learned the foundations of AI and machine learning — fields I’d always been curious about but never had the chance to explore in depth. With supportive instructors and hands-on activities, I built my first AI-powered website and discovered practical ways to use AI for creative solutions. The experience not only boosted my technical confidence but also motivated me to keep exploring advanced technologies and share what I learn with others, thanks to the inspiring KWK team.
