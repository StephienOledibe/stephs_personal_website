                    <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                        <p>I am an international student from Nigeria and a sophomore studying Computer Science at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania. I am on a journey to become a full-stack software developer, and I am actively working toward that goal by taking relevant courses and joining programs that help me grow.

                        <br>I am someone who loves setting goals and chasing them with purpose. I care deeply about creativity, making an impact, and building things that make life easier and better for others. My passion for people drives my interest in tech, because at the end of the day, I want to create solutions that help and bring joy to others.

                        <br>Outside of my career, I am someone who is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with God, my source of joy, happiness, hope, and the rock on which I stand. I strive to let His love and guidance reflect in everything I do, from the way I treat people to the goals I pursue and the impact I aim to make in the world.

                        <br>Two of my favorite Bible verses are Jeremiah 29:11 — “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope”, and Romans 9:16, “So then, it does not depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.” These verses remind me that God already knows the plans he has for me, and that everything that happens in my life is not dependent on my own desire or effort, but on His master plan, His grace, and His perfect timing.

                        <br>To sum it all up: I am a driven individual, passionate about making a difference in the world, with God as my guiding force every step of the way. PS: I love purple.</p>

            <h2>Battle of the Brains Competition(2025)</h2>
            <p>I had the incredible opportunity to represent my university for the first time at the 8th Annual HBCU Battle of the Brains, a prestigious 24-hour hackathon-style competition that brought together students from 25 Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the nation. As a first-time participant, I collaborated with a dynamic team of students from diverse backgrounds to tackle a real-world digital advertising challenge.</p>

            <p>Our task was to develop an innovative and sustainable solution to improve digital advertising. We proposed <strong>AmazonWish</strong>, a cutting-edge application that allows users to try out virtual models of products from the Amazon Marketplace before making a purchase. This interactive experience enabled us to design hyper-personalized advertisements that reduce ad waste and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>

            <p>Despite it being my school's first time participating, my team proudly secured third place among 25 amazing HBCUs that participated, a milestone that showcased our innovation, technical expertise, and ability to collaborate effectively under pressure.</p>

            <p>
            I had the incredible opportunity to attend the TMCF DevCon Conference, a three-day immersive experience designed for early-career students like myself. The conference provided an invaluable space to grow professionally, connect with inspiring peers and mentors, and gain clarity on potential career pathways.
            </p>

            <p>
            Through a variety of interactive workshops, main stage presentations, and personalized coaching sessions, I was able to strengthen key skills such as effective communication, leadership, problem-solving, and networking. I engaged in thought-provoking discussions with top industry leaders and learned practical strategies for navigating the evolving landscape of the workforce.
            </p>

            <p>
            DevCon not only equipped me with tools and insights to advance my career journey, but it also instilled a deeper sense of confidence and purpose. Being surrounded by driven, like-minded students and professionals reminded me of the importance of intentional growth, mentorship, and community support. The experience left me feeling empowered, inspired, and ready to take on new opportunities with clarity and determination.
